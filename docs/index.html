    <h1>The Minimum Vertex Cover Problem</h1>
    <p>
      The Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem is a classic optimization problem
      in computer science and graph theory. It deals with finding the smallest
      set of vertices in a graph that <code>covers</code> all the edges. This
      means that for every edge in the graph, at least one of its endpoints must
      be in the chosen set of vertices.
    </p>
    <h2>Formal Definition</h2>
    <p>
      Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices
      and $E$ is the set of edges, a vertex cover is a subset $V' \subseteq V$
      such that for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, at least one of the vertices $u$
      or $v$ belongs to $V'$. The Minimum Vertex Cover problem aims to find a
      vertex cover $V'$ with the smallest possible cardinality (i.e., the fewest
      number of vertices).
    </p>
    <h2>Importance and Applications</h2>
    <p>The Minimum Vertex Cover problem is important for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Theoretical Significance:</strong> It is a well-studied NP-hard
        problem, meaning that no known algorithm can solve it optimally for all
        instances in polynomial time. This makes it a crucial problem in
        complexity theory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practical Applications:</strong> It has applications in various
        fields, including:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Network security:</strong> Finding critical nodes in a
            network that, if compromised, would disrupt connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bioinformatics:</strong> Identifying important genes in gene
            regulatory networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wireless sensor networks:</strong> Determining the minimum
            number of sensors needed to monitor a given area.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Related Problems</h2>
    <p>
      The Minimum Vertex Cover problem is closely related to other graph
      problems, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Maximum Independent Set:</strong> A set of vertices where no two
        vertices are adjacent. The size of the minimum vertex cover plus the
        size of the maximum independent set is equal to the total number of
        vertices in the graph.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Set Cover Problem:</strong> A more general problem where sets of
        elements are used to cover a universe of elements.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Our Algorithm - Runtime $O(\vert V \vert^{3})$</h1>
    <h2>The algorithm explanation:</h2>
    <p>Steps in the Algorithm</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Input Validation: The algorithm checks if the input is a valid sparse
          adjacency matrix and handles edge cases (e.g., empty graph).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Graph Construction: The adjacency matrix is converted into a graph G
          using networkx.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Component Decomposition: The graph is decomposed into connected
          components.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): For each component, a minimum spanning
          tree is computed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bipartition and Matching: The MST is treated as a bipartite graph, and
          a maximum matching is found. The matching is used to compute a vertex
          cover for the bipartite graph.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Vertex Cover Construction: The union of vertex covers from all
          components forms the initial vertex cover.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Redundancy Removal: The algorithm removes redundant vertices from the
          vertex cover while ensuring that the remaining set still covers all
          edges.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Correctness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The algorithm ensures that every edge in the graph is covered by the
        vertex cover. This is achieved by:
        <ul>
          <li>Computing a vertex cover for each connected component.</li>
          <li>
            Using the properties of bipartite graphs and maximum matchings to
            ensure that all edges in the MST (and hence in the original graph)
            are covered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removing only those vertices that do not affect the coverage of
            edges (redundancy removal step).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The redundancy removal step ensures that the final vertex cover is
        minimal (no unnecessary vertices are included). Thus, the algorithm
        returns a valid vertex cover.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Runtime Analysis</h2>
    <p>The algorithm runs in polynomial time because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Constructing the graph from the adjacency matrix takes $O(\vert V\vert
          + \vert E\vert)$.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Computing the MST using Kruskal's algorithm takes $O(\vert E\vert \log
          \vert V\vert)$.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Computing the maximum matching and vertex cover for each bipartite
          graph takes $O(\vert V\vert^{2.5})$ (using Hopcroft-Karp algorithm).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The redundancy removal step takes $O(\vert V\vert \vert E\vert)$.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, the algorithm runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of
      the graph. Thus, the algorithm is a valid and efficient approximation
      algorithm for the vertex cover problem.

      (<code>-n</code>). Brute-force and heuristic comparisons are available but
      not recommended for large datasets due to performance issues.
