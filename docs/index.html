    <h1>The Minimum Vertex Cover Problem</h1>
    <p>
      The Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem is a classic optimization problem
      in computer science and graph theory. It deals with finding the smallest
      set of vertices in a graph that <code>covers</code> all the edges. This
      means that for every edge in the graph, at least one of its endpoints must
      be in the chosen set of vertices.
    </p>
    <h2>Formal Definition</h2>
    <p>
      Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices
      and $E$ is the set of edges, a vertex cover is a subset $V' \subseteq V$
      such that for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, at least one of the vertices $u$
      or $v$ belongs to $V'$. The Minimum Vertex Cover problem aims to find a
      vertex cover $V'$ with the smallest possible cardinality (i.e., the fewest
      number of vertices).
    </p>
    <h2>Visual Example</h2>
    <p>Consider the following simple graph:</p>
    <p>A --- B | | C --- D</p>
    <p>In this graph:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ${A, B, C, D}$ is a vertex cover (it includes all vertices, trivially
        covering all edges).
      </li>
      <li>
        ${B, C}$ is also a vertex cover, as it covers all edges: $(A, B)$, $(A,
        C)$, $(B, D)$, and $(C, D)$.
      </li>
      <li>
        ${A, D}$ is <em>not</em> a vertex cover because the edge $(B, C)$ is not
        covered.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>${B,C}$ is the minimum vertex cover for this graph.</p>
    <h2>Importance and Applications</h2>
    <p>The Minimum Vertex Cover problem is important for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Theoretical Significance:</strong> It is a well-studied NP-hard
        problem, meaning that no known algorithm can solve it optimally for all
        instances in polynomial time. This makes it a crucial problem in
        complexity theory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practical Applications:</strong> It has applications in various
        fields, including:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Network security:</strong> Finding critical nodes in a
            network that, if compromised, would disrupt connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bioinformatics:</strong> Identifying important genes in gene
            regulatory networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wireless sensor networks:</strong> Determining the minimum
            number of sensors needed to monitor a given area.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Related Problems</h2>
    <p>
      The Minimum Vertex Cover problem is closely related to other graph
      problems, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Maximum Independent Set:</strong> A set of vertices where no two
        vertices are adjacent. The size of the minimum vertex cover plus the
        size of the maximum independent set is equal to the total number of
        vertices in the graph.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Set Cover Problem:</strong> A more general problem where sets of
        elements are used to cover a universe of elements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Our Algorithm - Polynomial Runtime</h1>
    <h2>The algorithm explanation:</h2>
    <p>
      We employ the <code>minimum_edge_cut()</code> function from NetworkX to
      identify the minimum edge cut within an undirected graph. By iteratively
      solving the minimum edge cut problem on the connected components of the
      graph, we can obtain an approximate solution to the Minimum Vertex Cover
      Problem with an approximation ratio less than $\sqrt{2}$.

    <p>
      It generates random square matrices with configurable dimensions
      (<code>-d</code>), sparsity levels (<code>-s</code>), and number of tests
      (<code>-n</code>). Brute-force and heuristic comparisons are available but
      not recommended for large datasets due to performance issues.
      Additionally, the generated matrix can be written to the current directory
      (<code>-w</code>), and verbose output or file logging can be enabled with
      the (<code>-v</code>) or (<code>-l</code>) flag, respectively, to record
      test results.
